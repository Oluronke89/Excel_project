## Insights:
- The most viewed video is the “The band Metallica is the only brand to play on all seven continents”
- Videos labeled as “claims” tend to attract more engagement when compared to the ones labeled “opinions”. Claim refers to information that is either unsourced or from a verified source, this is of a concern as it can spread misinformation.
- Verified accounts have a slightly higher engagement rate when compared to non-verified accounts. This is because this allows users to confidently identify the authentic source and also enhance credibility of content there by building trust with the audience and attracting more followers and engagement.
- Mid-length videos (30-60 seconds) performed better with higher engagement rate when compared to the shorter videos (<30 seconds). This is because mid-length videos have the tendency to strike balance between content depth and brevity this explain why they have a better viewer retention.
- Verified accounts have the higher videos labeled as “claims” when compared with non-verified accounts. Also, it is worthy to note that both verified and unverified accounts post videos that make some kind of claim.
- Verified account have the higher banned videos when compared to non-verified account. 

## Recommendation:
- Content creators should get their account verified in order to get a boost in engagement
- Create videos that are 30-60 seconds long for better engagements.
- Creators should make their content interactive as this can help get more interaction
- Regulation of claim videos so as not spread misinformation on the platform
